                        <p> Since this was our first Arduino project, much of class time was spent going over some
                            examples of simple circuits we could build â€” namely the built-in examples of
                            <a href={links.blinkExample} style={{color: "rgb(100, 21, 255)"}}> Blink </a> and
                            <a href={links.buttonExample} style={{color: "rgb(100, 21, 255)"}}> Button</a>. The code and
                            schematics of these were relatively simple enough to follow along with which gave me a good
                            foundation with to go into the assignment.
                        </p>

                        <div style={styles.centerDiv50}>
                            <p> I ended up being able to create both the Blink and Button examples on two different half
                                breadboards as I had purchased a couple extra breadboards for a previous
                                <a href={links.jps} style={{color: "rgb(100, 21, 255)"}}> HCDE project</a>. Instead of
                                removing the components for each example, I thought it would be a great idea to combined
                                them both onto one breadboard as I wanted a way to still have both examples. With that
                                in mind, I drew up a schematic that would combine the two example projects, while
                                adapting it to fit the requirements for the first assignment.

                                It was pretty straightforward on how to build the circuit once I had the schematic
                                created. I carefully pulled out the components from the in-class Blink circuit and
                                repositioned them so that they matched the schematic. Afterwards, did the same for the
                                in-class Button circuit except I put the components on the same breadboard that housed
                                Blink circuit. I then connected all the ground wires appropriately so that all the LEDs
                                and the button would be fully connected.

                                After everything was plugged in, it was now time to program the code that would enable
                                the circuit to work properly. Using the in-class examples of Blink and Button, I compiled
                                the two and modified it to work properly with schematic. For the pattern of the LEDs, I
                                decided to have one LED turn on and off, followed by the other two, one after another.
                                This was done using <span style={{backgroundColor: "rgb(245, 245, 245)", fontFamily: "Monaco"}}>
